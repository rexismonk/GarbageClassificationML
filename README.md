# GarbageClassificationML
The Garbage Classification project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automated waste sorting, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional manual methods. It utilizes a custom CNN model, trained and validated on the Kaggle Garbage Classification dataset, comprising diverse image categories like cardboard, glass, and plastic. The methodology involves robust image preprocessing, data augmentation, and a clear train-validation-test split for objective evaluation. While the model demonstrates its foundational capability in classifying garbage, analysis indicates learning patterns alongside overfitting, highlighting areas for further refinement. This project showcases the potential of AI in advancing sustainable waste management and establishes a groundwork for future enhancements such as integrating transfer learning and enabling real-world deployment on edge devices.
